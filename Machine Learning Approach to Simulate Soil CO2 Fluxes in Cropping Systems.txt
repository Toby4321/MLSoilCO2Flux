This repository contains machine learning based models (MLSoilCO2Flux) that predict CO2 fluxes from cropping systems.

Packages to install before using the code
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit Learn
6. matplotlib.pyplot
7. mlxtend
8. scipy


Running the script

1. Set the working directory to the directory where your Measured_GHG_Fluxes_ML data is stored. 
This involves modifying this line in the code: "pd.read_csv(r"D:\Data\Measured_GHG_Fluxes_ML.csv")"

2. During data cleaning, you will be prompted to save your dataframe to your working directory using this line code
New_GHG_Data.to_csv("New_GHG_Data.csv").

3. Reupload the saved file using this line of code: New_GHG_Data=pd.read_csv(r"D:\Data\New_GHG_Data.csv")
